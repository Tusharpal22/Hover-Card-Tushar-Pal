# Hover-Card-Tushar-Pal

Create a hover card that displays an image of a product, its name, and its price. When the user hovers over the card, the image should zoom in slightly and the name and price should slide up from the bottom. The card should also have a subtle box-shadow and a border-radius to make it look more appealing. Use HTML to structure the card elements and CSS to style and animate them. You can use any image, name, and price for the product, or generate them randomly.

Some additional information or tips for the prompt are:

1)You can use the :hover pseudo-class in CSS to apply different styles to the card when it is hovered over.
2)You can use the transform property in CSS to scale the image and translate the name and price elements.
3)You can use the transition property in CSS to create smooth animations for the card elements.
4)You can use the position property in CSS to position the card elements relative to each other and the card container.
5)You can use the overflow property in CSS to hide the name and price elements when they are not hovered over.
